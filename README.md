# Discount.c
This is a c program in which if the value exceeds a certain limit it gives discount.
So to see the output of this c program you need to have gcc installed in your pc and type "gcc filename.c" in terminal and a output file with name "a.out" will be created.
This is your output file to see the output type "./a.out" in terminal and your c program will be displayed :)
Thanks
